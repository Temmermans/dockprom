# grafana-demo

## Endpoints in the demo

```
GET /bad => throws and error
GET / => random delay in response
GET /checkout => shop basket checkout (counter)
GET /metrics => endpoint for prometheus to pull from
```

## Metrics Exporter is ready, whatâ€™s next?

We have an exporter running and serving metrics, but no one is listening in yet. If you have docker running on your machine, you can use dockprom to quickly spin Prometheus+Grafana up.

```
git clone https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom
cd dockprom
ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin docker-compose up -d
```

Once docker-compose is up and running, you can visit the prometheus dashboard by going to localhost:9090 , the default http user and password are both admin.

And, you can find the Grafana dashboard at localhost:3000 (same user and pw).

Under dockprom/prometheus/prometheus.yml, we find an array of jobs prometheus will scrape. Add the following into the list:

```
- job_name: 'nodejs'
  scrape_interval: 10s
  honor_labels: true
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['host.docker.internal:3001']
```

Run `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

Prometheus will now:

- Scrape host.docker.internal:9991 (On Mac, host.docker.internal points to the local machine) every 10 seconds.

Refresh the prometheus landing page, and you will see under Status/Targets that our Node.JS app is now under watch!

## Prometheus

**First do some requests to the API.**

Next, try to type in http_request_duration_ms_bucket in the Graph Query Editor, and this will show up.

## Grafana

Because the graphs in prometheus are not enough to build dashboards, very basic functionality.

Click on create new dashbaord:

Afterwards, select add panel and click new query:
